# VacuumCleanerSimulation

This repository contains only the code that I wrote for the problem set. There is more helper code to run the project and it is only given by MITx on Edx.

The standard vacuum cleaner robots are allowed to travel linearly cleaning each tile, until they face an obstacle when they change direction.

The random walk vacuum cleaner robots are allowed to travel in any new direction for every step.

This simulation can be done on a given room, with a variable number of standard vacuum cleaner robots and a variable number of random walk based vacuum cleaner robots, thus for different sizes of rooms, different approaches with different number of robots relavant results can be drawn.
